### **Hands-on Exercises:**

#### **Part 1: Deploying a Stateless Application**

**Objective:** Deploy a simple stateless web application using a Kubernetes `Deployment`.

1. **Overview and Concepts (5 minutes)**
   - Stateless applications: Typically front-end or web services, no need to retain data between sessions
   - Best fit for Kubernetes `Deployments`

2. **Writing the Manifest (15 minutes)**
   - Create a new file: `stateless-app.yaml`
   - Define a `Deployment` for a sample web application (e.g., `nginx` or a basic Node.js app):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: stateless-app
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: stateless-app
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: stateless-app
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: web
             image: nginx:latest
             ports:
             - containerPort: 80
     ```
This manifest file, `stateless-app.yaml`, defines a **Kubernetes Deployment** for a stateless application. The deployment ensures high availability and scalability of the application by creating and managing multiple replicas of the application pods.

### **Explanation of the Manifest**

1. **`apiVersion: apps/v1`**  
   - Specifies the API version of the Kubernetes object. In this case, `apps/v1` is used for the Deployment object.

2. **`kind: Deployment`**  
   - Specifies the type of Kubernetes resource being created. Here, it is a **Deployment**, which manages the lifecycle of application pods.

3. **`metadata:`**  
   - Contains metadata about the Deployment.
   - `name: stateless-app`: Assigns the Deployment the name `stateless-app`.

4. **`spec:`**  
   - The `spec` section defines the desired state of the Deployment.

   - **`replicas: 3`**:  
     Specifies the number of pod replicas to run. Kubernetes ensures there are always 3 pods running for this Deployment.

   - **`selector:`**  
     Identifies which pods are managed by this Deployment. The selector matches pods with the label `app: stateless-app`.

   - **`template:`**  
     Describes the pod template, which defines how the pods created by this Deployment should look.

     - **`metadata:`**  
       - Contains labels for the pod. The label `app: stateless-app` associates the pods with the Deployment.
     
     - **`spec:`**  
       - Defines the pod specifications, including its containers.
     
       - **`containers:`**  
         - Lists the containers to be created within each pod.

         - **`- name: web`**:  
           Names the container `web` for easier identification.

         - **`image: nginx:latest`**:  
           Specifies the container image to use. In this case, it uses the latest version of the official `nginx` image from a container registry like Docker Hub.

         - **`ports:`**  
           - Specifies the ports exposed by the container.
           - **`- containerPort: 80`**:  
             Exposes port `80` inside the container. This is the default HTTP port for `nginx` to serve web traffic.

---

### **What This Manifest Does**
- Creates a **Deployment** named `stateless-app`.
- Ensures **3 replicas** of the pod are always running.
- Each pod runs a container with the `nginx:latest` image and exposes port `80` for HTTP traffic.
- Kubernetes monitors and maintains the desired state (e.g., if a pod crashes, it will automatically recreate it).

---


### **Key Benefits of This Deployment**
1. **High Availability**: Ensures multiple replicas of the app are running for fault tolerance.
2. **Scalability**: You can easily scale the application by changing the `replicas` count and reapplying the manifest.
3. **Stateless Nature**: Each pod is independent and does not maintain a persistent state, making it ideal for load-balanced applications. 

---
3. **Deploying and Testing (10 minutes)**
   - Apply the manifest: `kubectl apply -f stateless-app.yaml`
   - Verify the deployment: `kubectl get deployments`
   - Expose the deployment using a `Service` for external access:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: stateless-service
     spec:
       selector:
         app: stateless-app
       ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: 80
           targetPort: 80
       type: LoadBalancer
     ```
   - Apply and verify service accessibility

#### **Part 2: Deploying a Stateful Application**

**Objective:** Deploy a database application (e.g., MySQL) using a `StatefulSet`.

1. **Overview and Concepts (5 minutes)**
   - Stateful applications: Require persistent storage and unique network identifiers
   - Use cases for `StatefulSets` and need for `PersistentVolume` (PV) and `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC)

2. **Setting Up Persistent Storage (15 minutes)**
   - Create `PersistentVolume` (PV) and `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC):
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: PersistentVolume
     metadata:
       name: mysql-pv
     spec:
       capacity:
         storage: 5Gi
       accessModes:
         - ReadWriteOnce
       hostPath:
         path: "/mnt/data/mysql"  # For Minikube; change for cloud environment
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
     metadata:
       name: mysql-pvc
     spec:
       accessModes:
         - ReadWriteOnce
       resources:
         requests:
           storage: 5Gi
     ```

3. **Writing the StatefulSet Manifest (15 minutes)**
   - Create a new file: `stateful-app.yaml`
   - Define a `StatefulSet` for MySQL:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: StatefulSet
     metadata:
       name: mysql
     spec:
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: mysql
       serviceName: "mysql"
       replicas: 1
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: mysql
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: mysql
             image: mysql:5.7
             ports:
             - containerPort: 3306
               name: mysql
             env:
             - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
               value: "yourpassword"
             volumeMounts:
             - name: mysql-persistent-storage
               mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
       volumeClaimTemplates:
       - metadata:
           name: mysql-persistent-storage
         spec:
           accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
           resources:
             requests:
               storage: 5Gi
     ```

4. **Deploying and Testing (10 minutes)**
   - Apply the StatefulSet: `kubectl apply -f stateful-app.yaml`
   - Verify pod creation and persistent storage with `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get pvc`
   - Test database connectivity within the cluster (e.g., `kubectl exec -it mysql-0 -- mysql -uroot -p`)

#### **4. Cleaning Up Resources (5 minutes)**
   - Delete the created resources: `kubectl delete -f stateless-app.yaml -f stateful-app.yaml`
   - Optionally delete the PV and PVC.
